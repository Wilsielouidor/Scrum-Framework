## Scrum Events

<b>Sprint Planning: </b> 

Initiates the sprint by laying out the work that needs to be performed during the sprint. Sprint Planning is timeboxed to a maximum of <b>eight hours for a one-month Sprint</b>. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.

<b>Sprint planning addresses the following topics:</b> 
- Why is the Sprint Valuable?
- What can be done this sprint? 
- How will the chosen work get done? 

<b>Daily Scrum </b>

The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work. Daily Scrum is a <b>15 min event</b> for developers to be transparent and adapt to changes while discussing the work towards the sprint goal. *The Daily Scrum is not the only time Developers are allowed to adjust their plan. They often meet throughout the day for deeper discussions. 

<b>Sprint Review</b>

The purpose of the Sprint Review is to inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations. The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed.  The Sprint Review is the second to last event of the Sprint and is timeboxed to a maximum of <b>four hours for a one-month Sprint.</b> For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.

<b>Sprint Retrospective</b>

The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness. By discussing what worked and what did not work during the last sprint. Inspect the work that was completed and what was not completed. The Sprint Retrospective concludes the Sprint. It is timeboxed to a maximum of <b>three hours for a one-month Sprint.</b> For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.
The cycle continues again from the beginning with the goal of continuously improving.


## Scrum Artifacts 
Scrumâ€™s artifacts represent work or value. They are designed to maximize transparency of key information. Thus, everyone inspecting them has the same basis for adaptation.

<b> Product Backlog</b>

The Product Backlog is an emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product. It is the single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team. Commitment: For the Product backlog is the Product Goal.

<b> Sprint Backlog</b>

The Sprint Backlog is composed of the Sprint Goal (why), the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint (what), as well as an actionable plan for delivering the Increment (how). The Sprint Backlog is a plan by and for the Developers.

<b> Increment</b>

An Increment is a concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal. Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly verified, ensuring that all Increments work together. In order to provide value, the Increment must be usable.
